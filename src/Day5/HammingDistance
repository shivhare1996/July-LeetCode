 Problem Statement is to find the difference in bits in both the numbers.
 So, to find that we simply have to count the number of 1s in the XOR of both the number.

 XOR:
 1^0 = 1
 1^1 = 0
 0^0 = 0

How to count number of 1s in the number.

 Solution 1:

Simply shift the number one by one to the right and &(And) with 1 to find the rightmost digit, and count it.
Let x be the number. So till x != 0 do this. (X>>1 & 1)

Time Complexity O(n)
Space Complexity O(1)


 Solution 2:

This is the interesting solution. Notice what will happen if a (number) is AND with (number-1):

Number & (Number-1) : -> it will delete the rightmost set bit.

10101....1000 Let this be x
10101....0111 This will be x-1

so Anding these will set the rightmost set bit to 0.

To find the set bits in a number, x&(x-1), increase the count and set x to this (x&(x-1))

Time Complexity O(set Bits) -> which will be very fast.
Space Complexity O(1)
