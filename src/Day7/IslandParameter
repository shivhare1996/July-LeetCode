 Solution1 :

 To calculate parameter, we have to calculate the ones(land) in the 2D array.
 A block of land can have parameter between (0-4) units

 0 0 0      1 1 1
 0 1 0      1 1 1
 0 0 0      1 1 1

  (A)        (B)


Land A(middle-1) has paramter 4
Land B(middle-1) has paramter 0


SO we have to calculate the neighbours which made the parameter and check if it is land, it is not counted else counted.

Traverse through the array, check if the element is 1. If it is 1,
Increase the paramter to it's full capacity, see how many neighbours have 1 and decrease the parameter by 1.

 Time Complexity O(m*n)
 Space Complexity O(1)


 Solution2 :

 Little Optimization in above Solution is, you can check the neighbours in (i-1)(j) and (i)(j-1)
 All piece of land can be calculated (how many total 1, the island) and subtract by sharing boundaries, and as
 a boundary can be shared by only 2 peices of 1, so TotalOne*4 - SharingBoundaries*2 is the desired result.

  Time Complexity O(m*n)
  Space Complexity O(1)
